  We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes. Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.

  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:

  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.
  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.
  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.
  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.
  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press "Inspect".
  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).
  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.
